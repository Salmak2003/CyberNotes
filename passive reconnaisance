Passive Reconnaissance
In passive reconnaissance, you rely on publicly available knowledge
Tools Used : 
whois to query WHOIS servers
nslookup to query DNS servers
dig to query DNS servers

online services:
DNSDumpster
Shodan.io

WHOIS=>
Whois : provide info about domains or IPs
port : tcp 43
tools: "whois"
command:
whois tryhackme.com

DNS=>
give an IP a name (domain)
port : tcp 53
tools: "nslookup" & "dig"
commands:
nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1 (IPv4)
dig @1.1.1.1 tryhackme.com MX (mail server)

DNSDumpster : to list subdomains of a specific domain 
Shodan.io : to learn about a network without actively connecting to it 
Shodan.io tries to connect to every device reachable online to build a search engine of connected “things” in contrast with a search engine for web pages
